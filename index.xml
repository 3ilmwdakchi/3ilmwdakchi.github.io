          [0x0] Summary #  This week i enjoyed solving a reverse engineering challenge proposed by 0verfl0w in the context of the amazing malware analysis course zero2auto. The main task was to reverse engineer the string decryption routine used by Gozi. I really liked this challenge because it improve my technical and methodological skills, without too much drama here is my write up ☺️
[0x1] Unpacking the first stage #  When we start analyzing malware, one of the earlier verifications is to check if the sample that we are dealing with is packed .

          Hi there #  Salam wa 3alaykom! Hello world! My name is Ayman, I&amp;rsquo;m a cybersecurity engineer and i work as a soc analyst tier 1/2 with webhelp. I&amp;rsquo;m intrested in low level stuffs (reverse engineering / compilation / malware analysis / threat hunting / vulnerability research). I always believe that the best way to understand something is to explain this concept to others that&amp;rsquo;s why I write here some technical articles in my free time.
